# LaTeXLM

This repository contains a Chrome extension for rendering LaTeX on [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). The extension supports both inline and block expressions.
Inline math can be written using `$...$` or `\(...\)`, while block math uses `$$...$$` or `\[...\]`.

The extension relies on the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) runtime, which is **not included** in the repository. See [`notebooklm-latex-extension`](./notebooklm-latex-extension/) for instructions on downloading the KaTeX files and loading the extension.
